    <History>Fortified places called "Burhs" were built across the lands of Alfred the Great during his reign to help guard the land against Viking invaders. Burhs also served as shelter for people from nearby farms or villages during raids. The common distance between hamlets and a Burh was no more than 20 miles (32 km) away from each other, so that the villagers can quickly flee to safety during times of hostilities.</History>
