	"History": "The Norse of old were a north Germanic people who hailed from Scandinavia. During the early Middle Ages their regions expanded to Russia, England, Iceland and Greenland. They traveled to Asia as well as to the New World nearly 500 years before Columbus. Though feared for their fighting skills, they were also skilled traders and sailors. By the end of the Viking Age, which lasted from 793-1066 AD, their raids on the mainland faded, nonetheless they have left their mark on European culture and history.",
