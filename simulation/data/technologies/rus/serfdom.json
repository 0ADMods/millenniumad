	"genericName": "Serfdom",
	"description": "Serfdom, as any form of feudalism, was based on an agrarian economy. Day after day, serfs worked the land of their lords, barely leaving time to cultivate the land allotted to them to take care of their family. The lordâ€™s land was divided by the peasant commune (obshchina or mir), into large fields. Each field was divided into strips and each family given so many strips in each field according either to the number of male workers in the family or the number of mouths to feed.",
